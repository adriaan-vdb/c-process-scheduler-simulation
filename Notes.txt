--> Questions:
1. Do we need Fork to create new processes when each command is called?
2. Does a process continue making system calls until the time quantum is expired?




--> Notes:
1. I reckon we share a onenote page so we can plan our system on "Whiteboard"
2. Only the first command on the command file is run (depend on spawns for the rest)
3. Every time a process needs to use the databus, it takes 20usecs before commencing
4. For calculating time on databus, need to round up to the highest integer (e.g. 14.2usec -> 15usecs)
5. Execution time of a system call is the total running execution time of the process on the CPU
6. The CPU performs state transitions (state transitions will take time on the CPU)
7. Sleeping starts and doesn't care about what is happening on CPU (this includes it's own state transition from RUNNING -> BLOCKED)
8. Reading of command file records the execution time (as well as cumulative time) taken to do a syscall
9. Need to initialise integer value remaining_cpu_time to 0!!!!
